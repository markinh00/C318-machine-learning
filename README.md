# C318-machine-learning

This project is a machine learning analysis based on the [Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) provided by Kaggle. The dataset contains information about medical insurance charges billed to customers based on various attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and apply machine learning models to predict insurance charges. This analysis provides insights into the factors that influence insurance costs and evaluates model performance using regression techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Insurance Dataset by mirichoi0218](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

It includes the following columns:
- `age`: age of the primary beneficiary
- `sex`: insurance contractor gender (female, male)
- `bmi`: Body mass index
- `children`: Number of children covered by health insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no)
- `region`: Residential region in the US
- `charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
It is highly recommended that you use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies.
### ðŸ“¥ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/markinh00/C318-machine-learning.git
cd C318-machine-learning
```
### ðŸ“¦ Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then open the `main.ipynb` file and run the cells step by step.
